# CytoWeave requirements

What CytoWeave must do, and the status of each requirement in 0.7.0.
- `research.md` explains why each requirement is here: the methods and
  standards of §3–4 and the design implications of §8.
- `design.md` explains how the requirements are met.

Status: **done**, **partial** (the gap is noted) or **planned** (see
`roadmap.md`).

## Users

- **Bench scientists** analyzing their own experiments. They want the
  FlowJo workflow to be faster, and free.
- **Core facility staff** who check many samples and teach analysis. They
  want consistency, QC and explanations.
- **Computational cytometrists** who need high-dimensional methods,
  reproducibility and scripting without giving up an interactive tool.
- **AI agents** acting for any of them, through a typed and auditable
  interface.
